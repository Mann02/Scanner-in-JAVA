JAVA provides a built in support for multithreading programming. 

**What is Multithreading**
MultiThreading a a way of dividing program into small threads where each thread defines a seperate path for its execution.
We can call it multitasking but Multithreading is a specialized form of multithreading.

**Is there any priority for threads in a program?**
Yes, JAVA provides priority for each thread. Priorities are given according integer values. A Threads priority is used to decide when to
switch from one thread to another. This switching of threads from one running thread to another is called as context switching



**Methods used for managing threads**

Our thread class defines several methods which are used to manage threads. Some of these methods ( basically what i know and 
which fall under category of core JAVA ) are shown below - -- - 

``getName`` is used to obtain the threads name

``isAlive`` is used to check wheather our thread is running or not

``join`` is used to wait for running thread to terminate

``run`` is used to start the thread. It is an entry point for a thread

``sleep`` is used to suspend a thread for a particular period of time

``start`` is used to start the thread by calling its run method
