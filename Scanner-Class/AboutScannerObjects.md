What is Scanner class and how to use it in our programs

Scanner class is a predefined JAVA class which is used to take input from the user. Scanner class need package for its functioning. The util package contain the required files for the Scanner class to work in our programs.

We need to first import the packages in our program with the syntax import java.util.Scanner;

OK now the question is what is this package? This is the syntax to import the util package into our program for the use of Scanner class. Some people face difficuty in learning the way to import the package, here's an easy way. Its how i learnt it - First, the import thing tells the compiler to import the package what user defined so its quiet obvious that the import word should go at the start of defining packages. Second the word java shows the package is of JAVA lang and it is also obvious cause we are working on JAVA lang. Third is the word util which is name of the package itself so we need to learn the name of packages in order to use them in our programs. Last but not the least is the word Scanner which tells the compiler what package inside the main util package we want. Like for using the Scanner class we only need to specific Scanner class files and no other files so we can use the specific Scanner files inside our util package. In cases people do not remember the name of Scanner class ( its a 5% chance :p ) so they can all use the star(*) in place of Scanner.

Ok now another question is What exactly is Star(*) Star mean that we are not including a specific object from our util package but we want everything inside the util package. This means everything inside the util package will be imported to our JAVA program and will be used. The syntax of this package is like import java.util.*;

This is all we need for learning the working of the Scanner class inside our program.
