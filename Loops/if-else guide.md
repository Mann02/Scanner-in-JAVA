#Statements Guide


Program enters the statement and find for the matching condition according to user input. Let us take an example of our ``if-else.java``
file. In that file the console first asks for a number from user. It stores the number inside the ``num`` variable and then enters
our if-else statement, finds the matching condition for the input provided, prints to the consoleu and exits the statement.


**isn't it very similar to switch statements we discussed before?**
Yes you are right, it does the same work what switch statements do. Its upto user what statement he want to use to make
dicision in his/her programs. I personally love to use if-else statements over switch statements.
