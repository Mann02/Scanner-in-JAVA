#CMD Guide for running programs

Ok although running JAVA programs on CMD looks old fashioned an gives us the feeling that we are coding in 80's :p
I suggest using software for JAVA programming like ``Netbeans IDE`` or ``Eclipse``. These softwares will give you a feel like of
a professional coder and will make up your mood for coding more !!

**I have a bad and slow internet. What to do?**
Oh so thats the problem? Usually netbeans and eclipse softwares are 250+ MB and can take time when downloaded over a 
bad internet connection. But there is a way you can code in modern way without using crappy old fashioned notepad. Download the 
software ``Sublime text 2``. It is just like notepad but isn't old fashioned and its only 2Mb. Happy Coding

**How to run program on cmd once i wrote the program?**
Ok so you wrote a JAVA program on Notepad or Sublime Text or whatever, now you need to run it on cmd.

1) You need to download ``JDK ( JAVA Development Kit )`` in order to run programs
